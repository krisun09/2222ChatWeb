# This file provides a very simple "no sql database using python dictionaries"
# If you don't know SQL then you might consider something like this for this course
# We're not using a class here as we're roughly expecting this to be a singleton

# If you need to multithread this, a cheap and easy way is to stick it on its own bottle server on a different port
# Write a few dispatch methods and add routes

# A heads up, this code is for demonstration purposes; you might want to modify it for your own needs
# Currently it does basic insertions and lookups
